This is the arduino code
This is free to use :-) (I don't know why but i love writing this line)

Hello everbody i am satinder singh, i am acomputer engineering student at Army Institute of Technology in pune
This is my code for identifying basic red,green and blue color and connecting this with a servo to project this physically

if you don't have knowledge about processing and want to learn about it i would recommend you Daniel shiffmans channel "The Coding Train"

The link to youtube video for this project is : 

the components required are
arduino uno
jumper wires
servo
motor shield(can work without it also)
laptop with processing and arduino installed

just connect VCC,GROUND to GND and 5V of the arduino
and connect the third pin of servo to any digital pin



You can check the other file for processing code

#include<Servo.h>                            //including the library for servo
Servo x;                                     //creating a object x of class Servo
char y;                                      //variable y of char type
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
Serial.begin(9600);                          //starting the Serial connection with a baud rate of 9600
x.attach(11);                                 //attaching the servo to pin number 11(yours may vary)
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
if(Serial.available()>0)                      //checking if there is any data coming Serially
{
  
   y=Serial.read();                           //storing the data received in y
  if(y=='1')                                   //checking if value received is 1 and rotating the servo
  x.write(180);                                 
  if(y=='2')                                  //checking if value received is 2 and rotating the servo
  x.write(85);
  if(y=='3')                                  //checking if value received is 3 and rotating the servo
  x.write(7);
  }
